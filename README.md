## Hi there 👋

I'm MeriexDev, a programmer based in the Philippines.

I'm currently learning Front-end development that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I can also do Figma for UI designs, I am not that good for now but I am learning.

This is a new profile where I'll be uploading my progress and small projects that will help me with my career in the future. Everything I will do are going to be original and no copy/paste templates.

## Tools
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Java, C#, Python

## About me
* I am a second year IT student from STI.
* I'm a morning person and can stay up very late if necessary.
* I love learning and applying what I learned to my future projects.
